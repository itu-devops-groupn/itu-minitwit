## Autorelease and semantic versioning (how-to)

A workflow is run on every merge where changes are made to the src-folder on main. The workflow will take the latest release version tag and increment in by one (patch) by default. This means, that if you merge 10 commits to main, only 1 version increment will happen. It is also possible to update the minor- and major-version by either writing \#minor or \#major in the commit message. This will then increment the major (and reset patch and minor) if that is asked for, or increment minor (and reset patch).

A release will also be made. The release will have the autogenerated changelog for releases and the tag defined above will be used. This release will be set to latest.

## How to run in docker

To do this, the connection string must be setup properly.
To run the program, follow these steps:

1. **Build Docker Images:**

   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   ```

2. **Start Containers:**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --remove-orphans
   ```

   This command will start the necessary containers. The `--remove-orphans` option removes any containers for services not defined in the Compose file.

## Setup test suite (not updated to psql)

1. Create empty test db

   ```bash
   touch /tmp/test-minitwit.db &&
   sqlite3 /tmp/test-minitwit.db < schema.sql
   ```

2. Start your application in docker

3. Make sure you have downloaded 'minitwit_simulator.py' and 'minitwit_scenario.csv'.
   Run following commands from repo root directory (itu-minitwit):

   ```bash
   curl -L -o test/minitwit_simulator.py https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itu-devops/lecture_notes/master/sessions/session_03/API_Spec/minitwit_simulator.py
   ```

   ```bash
   curl -L -o test/minitwit_scenario.csv https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itu-devops/lecture_notes/master/sessions/session_03/API_Spec/minitwit_scenario.csv
   ```

4. Test

   ```bash
   python3 test/minitwit_simulator.py "http://localhost:5050"
   ```

   Only errors are displayed in the output

5. Verify that /tmp/test-minitwit.db is now filled up with data
